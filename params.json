{"name":"PyCalendarGen","body":"[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jwarlander/pycalendargen.png)](https://travis-ci.org/jwarlander/pycalendargen)\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n=======\r\n\r\nPyCalendarGen is a command-line utility that generates calendar pages\r\nfor use in, for example, a photo calendar. Output is configurable by\r\nselecting one of several languages, colors, and fonts. Special dates\r\ncan be entered into the data file for the corresponding language, so\r\nthat they will appear in the rendered output.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nJust unpack the archive somewhere useful, and run PyCalendarGen.py\r\nfrom the installation directory (so it will find the fonts).\r\n","tagline":"Generate customizable calendar pages in PDF format","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","google":""}
